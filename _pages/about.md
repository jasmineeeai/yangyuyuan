## Hi there 👋 I’m Yuyuan (Jasmine) Yang

Business Analyst and aspiring Data Analyst with B2B SaaS experience. I turn complex data into clear stories and actionable strategies—highlighting opportunities, de-risking decisions, and driving measurable outcomes.

### What I do
- **Insight & opportunity finding:** Identify growth levers, churn risks, and efficiency gaps through rigorous analysis and hypothesis-driven exploration.
- **Data visualization & storytelling:** Build intuitive dashboards and narrative reports that surface the “so what” for executives and frontline teams.
- **Requirements to delivery:** Translate business needs into implementable specs; validate with data; iterate to impact.
- **Product enablement:** User training, playbooks, and documentation that reduce support load and speed up adoption.

### Toolbelt
- **Analytics:** SQL, Excel, Tableau, R/Python, NLP
- **Visualization & Media:** Tableau (story points), Final Cut Pro, Camtasia, Photoshop  
- **Collaboration:** Cross-functional work with SMEs, engineers, and GTM teams

### How I work
I blend quantitative depth with clear communication—framing insights in business language, prioritizing by ROI, and packaging results as visual stories teams act on.
